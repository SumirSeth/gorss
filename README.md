# Goal:
A production-ready, extensible RSS Aggregator API written in Go. It should:

- Accept feed URLs

- Periodically fetch + parse them (RSS/Atom)

- Cache items in memory or DB

- Expose a REST API to serve data to frontend

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for production use.
